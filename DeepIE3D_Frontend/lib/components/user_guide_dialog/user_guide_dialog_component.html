            <p>This browser-based tool let's you create beautiful 3D models without all the hassle!</p>
            <p>
                Whether you need 3D models for concept development, computer games, 3D printing or purely for fun, DeepIE3D
                will do the trick.
            </p>
            <p>
                In DeepIE3D, there're two ways of reaching your desired 3D model: The regular approach, called "Normal
                Mode", and the custom approach, called "Advanced Mode".
            </p>
            <h3>General Principles</h3>
            <p>
                In each iteration of 3D modelling, you're presented with nine 3D models from a certain domain (e.g.
                airplanes or chairs).
                These 3D models are evolved troughout the process - when you're satisfied with one or more of the 3D models,
                you're done. During the process, you'll always have the following possibilities:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-less">
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">

                            Force novelty in 3D models: Widens the distribution of newly created 3D models, resulting in more
                            different 3D models (experimential feature, turned off for now)
                        </p>

            <p>To advance to the next evolutionary iteration, press the "INITIALIZE EVOLUTION" button.</p>
            <h3>Normal Mode</h3>
            <p>
                This is the default mode. It utilizes the original DeepIE algorithm to evolve chosen 3D models. This
                involves mutating, combining and generating new  3Dmodels. In this mode, in addition to the general
                possibilities, you're able to perform the following actions:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-less">
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">
                        <material-icon class="icon-description" icon="favorite_border">
                        </material-icon>
                        <p>Mark a 3D model as a candidate to the DeepIE algorithm</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advanced Mode</h3>
            <p>
                As the name states, this is the advanced mode as it let's you custimize the next evolutionary iteration
                completely. Each evolutionary iteration consists of a generation of nine 3D models. How these nine 3D model
                look is fully based on the evolution they undergo - you decide. In addition to the general
                possibilities, you're able to perform the following actions:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-less">
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">
                        <material-icon class="icon-description" icon="lock">
                        </material-icon>
                        <p>Mark a 3D model as being kept in its original form in the next evolutionary iteration</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">
                        <material-icon class="icon-description" icon="shuffle">
                        </material-icon>
                        <p>Mark a 3D model as being combined with another to-be-chosen 3D model in the next
                            evolutionary iteration</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">
                        <material-icon class="icon-description" icon="tune">
                        </material-icon>
                        <p>Mark a 3D model as being mutated in the next evolutionary iteration</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To keep track of the next generation of nine 3D models, you'll be able to see the upcoming evolutions to
                the right - if you dislike one, you can remove it. Additionally, you'll be able to keep track of how
                a certain 3D model contributes to the next evolutionary iteration by observing the icons in its top left
                corner.
