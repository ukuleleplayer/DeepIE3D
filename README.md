# Welcome to the source code of DeepIE3D!

DeepIE3D is short for Deep Interactive Evolutionary 3D Modelling. As the name hints, it is a concept using deep learning combined with evolutionary principles used to evolve 3D models. Please see the [website](https://adrianwesth.dk) for the final result/prototype!

With this code in your hands, you'll be able to deploy DeepIE3D yourself, we've provided access to:

1. Training of DeepIE3D models (GANs): [DeepIE3D_Training](DeepIE3D_Training)
2. Backend of DeepIE3D (evolution etc.): [DeepIE3D_Backend](DeepIE3D_Backend)
3. Frontend of DeepIE3D (3D rendering and interaction): [DeepIE3D_Frontend](DeepIE3D_Frontend)
